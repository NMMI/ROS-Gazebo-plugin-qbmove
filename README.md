# ROS-Gazebo-plugin-qbmove
ROS-Gazebo plugin for simulate the elastic bheavior of the qbmove actuators in Gazebo. 
For those not familiar with these actuators, in brief, the *qbMove* is a compliant actuator with varible stiffness, based on the agonistic-antagonistic principle presented in [Catalano M. et. al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980457), developed by [qbRobotics](https://qbrobotics.com/).

The plugin supposes to be able to control the motor position references of the real qbmoves. 
_I'm planning to include the motor dynamics as well, from which test torque controllers, developping another complementary plugin._ROS-Gazebo plugin for simulate the elastic bheavior of the qbmove actuators in Gazebo.
